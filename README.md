# Ghost-Theme-Examples
A bunch of examples of different Ghost theme customizations

This repo houses different branches for each of our posts to show live examples of the code. The default code is based on the [Casper theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) written and maintained by the official Ghost organization. 

Each post has their own branch with the code inside. Suggestions for improvements more than welcome!
