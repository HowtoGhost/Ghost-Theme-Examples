# Ghost-Theme-Examples
-------

_Awesome examples showing theme customizations for your Ghost blog._

This repo houses different branches for each of our posts to show live examples of the code. The default code is based on the [Casper theme](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper) written and maintained by the official Ghost organization. 

Each post has its own branch with code examples. Suggestions for improvements are more than welcome!
